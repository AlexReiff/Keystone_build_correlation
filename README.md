Just a quick thing I put together that shows the three most common items for each keystone. This is the first draft so there are a lot of shortcomings.


##Methodology:

I used the most common keystone for each champion then added that champion's most common 'core items' to that rune. Because it is only the most common choices, there are obviously a lot of missing data points (notably Hail of Blades never being the most common keystone for any champion, but it's the 2nd most for Jhin)
Champions that play multiple roles only include their most common role because first draft and no other good reason.
